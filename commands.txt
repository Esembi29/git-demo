Oh you need to git add global first. As Ms. Princess stated a few minutes ago
git config --global user.name
git config --global user.email
If you run this

git config --global user.name
git config --global user.email

it will show your global name and email. If there is none, you should add one with this:

git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"

git log 
	- displays all the commits that were made
